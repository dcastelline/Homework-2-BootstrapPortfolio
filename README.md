# **Homework-2-BootstrapPortfolio**

This is my portfolio, created to showcase my work and my progress as I learn more about web development and coding.  This portfolio was created with **HTML** and **CSS** using **Bootstrap**.  This project gave me a the chance to experiment with **Bootstrap** to style and scale my site.

### **Table of Contents**

My portfolio project consists of **About Me**, **My Portfolio**, and **Contact Me** pages that are navigable via links in the navbar.  On smaller screens, the links are in a dropdown in the navbar.
