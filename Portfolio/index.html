                        I'm Daniel, and I was born and raised here in Austin.  I have always enjoyed computers and found coding interesting, and I am fascinated by the amazing things people can do with computers.  After high school I joined the Marine Corps as a Rifleman and served for five years.  After leaving the Marines, I became a police officer in East Texas.  I had been wanting to change careers when this opportunity arose, and now I look forward to my future in programming.

                    <p>
                        Outside of enjoying computers, I grew up playing music and sports.  I played the saxophone and trumpet, participating in band, orchestra, jazz band, and musicals throughout school.  With a father who had competed in triathalons and several Iron Man competitions, I played soccer, roller hockey, football, and lacrosse.  Now, my free time is spent with my family or playing lacrosse with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ajlc.org/#/">Austin Jazz Lacrosse Club</a>, a nonprofit organization that is aimed at spreading lacrosse in Central Texas through adult and youth league expansion.
